## Why SQL to CPT?

This plugin helps you migrate legacy __SQL database tables__ to WordPress' __Custom Post Types (CPT)__. It provides a user-friendly interface that enables users upload an SQL file which is then parsed and converted to a CPT with meta data that is recognisable within WordPress.

If you ever need to migrate a non-WordPress database table into WP, look no further. This is exactly what you need!
